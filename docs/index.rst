Welcome to quma's docs
======================

quma is a simple **Python** >= v3.5 and **SQLite**/**PostgreSQL**/**MySQL**/**MariaDB**
library which maps methods to SQL scripts. Unlike ORMs, it allows to write SQL 
as it was intented and to use all featuers the DBMS provides. It also provides 
a simple connection pool.
